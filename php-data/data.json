With the rise of Generative AI (GenAI), cybercriminals are seemingly armed with unprecedented tools, flooding the digital world with sophisticated, unblockable threats. This talk aims to dissect the hype and uncover the reality behind the use of GenAI in cybercrime.\nWe will explore the growing use of deepfakes in scams, exemplified by a million dollar fake BEC video conference fraud. From son-in-trouble scams to KYC bypass schemes, deepfakes are becoming a versatile tool for cybercriminals.\nMoving to phishing attacks, we\u2019ll discuss how GenAI personalizes and automates social engineering, significantly increasing the volume of attacks.\nWe'll also showcase how GenAI can generate basic malware and explore advanced threats like polymorphic\/metamorphic malware that dynamically adapts in real time. By clarifying the differences between AI-generated, AI-aided, and AI-powered threats, we reveal that while GenAI facilitates threat distribution, true AI-powered malware is still rare.\nConcluding, we\u2019ll address the common confusion between automation and AI-powered attacks, emphasizing that while GenAI scales and accelerates attacks, it does not fundamentally create completely new threat patterns. We will also highlight future research areas, such as exploiting zero-day vulnerabilities and supply chain attacks against GenAI. Join us to distinguish between the hype and the real impact of AI in cybercrime, and understand what this means for the future of cybersecurity defense.",

            "abstract": "\n\nTrusted Execution Environments form the backbone of mobile device security architectures. The GlobalPlatform Internal Core API is the de-facto standard that unites the fragmented landscape of real-world implementations, providing compatibility between different TEEs.\n\nIn our research we reveal that this API standard is prone to a design weakness. Manifestations of this weakness result in critical type-confusion bugs in real-world user-space applications of the TEE, called Trusted Applications (TAs). At its core, the design weakness consists of a fail-open design leaving an optional type check for untrusted data to TA developers. The API does not mandate this easily forgettable check that in most cases results in arbitrary read-and-write exploitation primitives. To detect instances of these type-confusion bugs, we design and implement GPCheck, a Ghidra-based static binary analysis system capable of vetting real-world TAs. We employ GPCheck to analyze 14,777 TAs deployed on widely used TEEs to investigate the prevalence of the issue. We reconfirm known bugs that fit this pattern and discover unknown instances of the issue in the wild. In total, we confirmed 9 known bugs, found 10 instances of silently-fixed bugs, and discovered a surprising amount of 14 0-days using our GPCheck prototype. Our findings affect mobile devices currently in use by billions of users. We responsibly disclosed these findings, already received >12,000 USD as bug bounty, and were assigned four CVEs. Ten of our 14 0-days are still in the responsible disclosure process.\n\nIt comes without surprise that a vulnerability in a single TA impacts the security of the entire device and, thus, vendors must rapidly fix such vulnerabilities and revoke vulnerable versions to prevent rollback attacks, i.e., loading an old version of the TA to exploit a known vulnerability. We will supplement the findings from above with a large-scale study on TA rollback prevention indicating severe deficiencies in the mobile ecosystem regarding the usage of N-days against TEEs.\n",

Coupled with the fact that a leaked access token lets a malicious user use them without any constraints adds to the problem. If the leaked access token has high-privileges that compounds the impact of such a leak. There haven\u2019t been many mitigations that an application or a user generating an access token could use to reduce or eliminate the impact of a token misuse until RFC 9449 came about which introduced a concept called Demonstrating Proof of Possession (DPoP) for OAuth access tokens.\n\nProof-of-possession is a security mechanism at the application level that sender-constrains access tokens by using public\/private key pairs. It binds the generated access token to a user's public key and thereby requires attackers to prove possession of the corresponding private key when using that access token. This constrains the access token to the user who generated it, as only they have access to their private key and gives the application, that is receiving the access token, added assurance that it is indeed the user who generated the access token that is using it and no one else. At GitLab, we are working on implementing the DPoP mechanism for Personal Access Tokens to eliminate the impact of accidental token disclosures.\n\nIn this talk, we will establish why accidental token disclosures are a problem, discuss the DPoP mechanism that we are implementing for personal access tokens, share the technical blueprint we wrote and also demonstrate the PoC showing the solution in action. Participants will leave this talk with a greater understanding of the utility of a mechanism like DPoP and how it can eliminate the problem of access token misuse.\n",

Shortly after, it was shown that all mainstream lattice based FHE schemes actually end up being vulnerable to the same attack and that they also need to satisfy the notion of IND-CPA-D security in these scenarios.\n\nSince then the FHE community has been divided and caught in an iterative process on how to achieve IND-CPA-D security in a practical and provable way, with most of the proposed solutions ending up being either broken or impractical.\n\nCan IND-CPA-D security be achieve in a way that is both practical and provably secure?",

This presentation aims at demonstrating the potential of Group Policy Objects from an offensive standpoint by describing standard \/ known attack vectors targeting GPO ACLs, but also a new, more versatile exploitation technique recently published by the speaker.\n\nThe research behind the talk stem from a pentest performed on an Active Directory environment, during which permissive ACLs on sensitive Group Policy Objects were discovered. An overview of the standard, existing attack vectors available when targeting GPOs permissions was performed - which however also highlighted some of their limits. More specifically, it was observed that such existing attack vectors were not applicable in NTLM relaying scenarios, which was precisely the position of the auditor during the tests. As a result, an alternative attack vector relying on the manipulation of the gPCFileSysPath LDAP attribute was developed, allowing a safer and stealthier exploitation of GPO ACLs that is also applicable in NTLM relaying scenarios.",

Automated analysis has limits, and we will discuss them.\nThis talk is also a call to the community to reflect on possible improvements to existing tooling, including usability and continuous translation of insights from real-world attacks and formal analysis into actionable items for application developers. A fruitful collaboration on increased usability, meaningful security goals, and analyses with automated tooling has the potential to make automated analysis an invaluable layer in the Swiss-cheese model for security systems that rely on cryptography.",

In practice these enforcements are usually ineffective. This talk starts by explaining basic isolation assumptions and quickly shifts to exploitation. I have selected a few the most popular macOS password managers written in different technologies to prove how a low-privileged malware can abuse various tricks and 0,n-day vulnerabilities to drain your credentials.\n\nDuring this talk you will:\n- learn how macOS hardened runtime, sandboxing, and TCC app management privilege work\n- see 0,n-day vulnerabilities and architectonical problems I have found in popular macOS password managers\n- understand why software distributed via websites is sometimes more secure than from the Apple Mac App Store\n- see my exploits and a lot of demos\n\nAfter the talk, the audience should be able to explain macOS isolation mechanisms (in)security, check their password managers for presented vulnerabilities, and effectively support their macOS blue\/red teams.

            "lang": "en",
            "abstract": "A few months ago, I stumbled upon a 24 years old buffer overflow in the glibc. Despite being reachable in multiple well-known libraries or programs, it proved rarely exploitable. Indeed, this was not a good bug: with hard-to-achieve preconditions, it did not even provide a nice primitive. A 1 to 3 bytes overflow, with uncontrolled bytes, with heavy requirements, proved very hard to find in the wild. On PHP however, it lead to amazing results: a new exploitation technique that affects the whole PHP ecosystem, and the compromission of several applications.\n\nThis talk will first walk you through the discovery of the bug and its limitations, before describing the conception of several remote binary PHP exploits, and through them offer unique insight in the internal of the engine of the web language, and the difficulties one faces when exploiting it. Every concept will be described along the way: from understanding the power of file reads in PHP, to describing its heap and internal structures.\n\nAfter exploiting the bug using PHP filters, I will showcase the exploitation of direct calls to iconv() on a popular PHP webmail. In both cases, I will describe the impact on the PHP ecosystem, and document the manner I used to build exploits.\n",

            "abstract": "As sophisticated as GuLoader; a highly obfuscated and evasive malware loader, Here comes a similar loader with various evasion capabilities built-in to execute malware stagers in memory; The IDAT Loader. First seen in August 2023, WatchTower has analyzed and identified multiple attack chains delivering malwares like Lumma, Redline, Danabot, Vidar and Amadey. We have found two variants of IDAT loader in the wild, specifically Vidar and Lumma operators using the first variant, where threat actors use a C2 to download decoy PNG files with a malicious IDAT section and the other variant containing the decoy packed within itself eliminating the the malicious C2 connection.\n\nThe IDAT loader first contacts a legitimate domain, followed by a request to a C2 server to download a PNG file. This PNG is a decoy that contains malicious shellcode and the process it needs to be injected into using Process Doppelganging. The loader searches for the string \u201cIDAT'' DWORD in the downloaded PNG file to fetch the XOR key that immediately follows, and the rest is encrypted data. Once the data is decrypted, it holds the decompressed data, which is later decompressed using RtlDecompressBuffer. The result contains the shellcode and the name of the legitimate Windows process to again inject into.\n\nWe will present on the code-level reverse engineering of both variants of IDAT loader used to deploy Amadey, Raccoon, Lumma, and Vidar, and discuss the similarities between their code blocks. Our presentation will conclude with a discussion of our hunting techniques, which we use to stay ahead of IDAT loader campaigns and protect our customers globally.\n",
